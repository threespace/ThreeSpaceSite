intro_paragraph: >
  Three Space Lab is an early-stage MIT Media Lab spin-off company working on VR and AR software solutions for education, training, and workplace learning, with a focus on uses of interactive simulation. Some previous projects have focused on electricity and magnetism, crystalline structures, 3D scanning, and tools for visual design of brands. We are a team of designers and engineers focused on building world-class collaborative spatial computing systems. Our work builds on years of experience in multi-user virtual reality and scientific visualization.
